                        This was my first work-for-accomodation stint, and looking back, I absolutely wouldn't have it any other way.
                        <a href="https://westcoast.co.nz/visit/discover/highlights/haast-world-heritage-area/" target="_blank">Haast</a> 
                        is a small town located on the West Coast of New Zealand's South Island (est. population of 200), and its remote 
                        and rugged landscape meant that we had an off-the-beaten-path experience right off the bat.
                    </p>

                        Listed as a UNESCO World Heritage area, Haast is surrounded by stunning mountains, rivers, and forests, making 
                        it the perfect place to kickstart our journey as hardcore trampers. <br><br> Just kidding, I don't think I ever unlocked
                        that status.

                    <h3>The Plan</h3>
                    <p>
                        Given that we have 0 experience with working in NZ, we blindly applied to listings on HelpX without being too picky
                        about it. Location didn't matter - we were willing to go with whoever would accept us and that could work with
                        my restrictive schedule.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We got a few ghostings and rejections, but then received our first offer from a small motel in Haast. The timing 
                        worked out perfectly and at the end of March 2024, we bid Keet (our airbnb host who was such a great help) farewell
                        and set off from Christchurch to Haast, which was about a 5-hour drive away. We stopped by Hokitika to break up the
                        drive (it was our first proper "long" drive!) and thankfully made it safe and sound to Haast. The journey itself was
                        a treat, going from Arthur's Pass down the windy West Coast roads, till cellphone reception got more limited and eventually
                        non-existent.

                        Work started at 9am and ended at 1pm, with a 30-minute "smoko" in between. My duties generally began with stripping the beds,
                        bringing the dirty linen and towels to the laundry room and replacing them with clean ones (other staff members handled
                        making the beds). I would then go room to room to vacuum and wipe down surfaces, and lastly, mop the bathroom and kitchenette
                        floors.
