                        Naturally, no working holiday blog would be complete without a section dedicated to the work experience itself.
                        I was very lucky (and super grateful!!) that my employer in SG was willing to accomodate my quest to embark on this adventure
                        - it meant that I had more leeway when it came to financing my travels, and I could seek out opportunities I was happy with
                        without worrying too much about costs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Depending on your skillsets and industry, it might be worth negotiating an arrangement that works out for both parties,
                        if your boss is agreeable to it. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Work Arrangements</h2>
                    <p>
                        While I was able to have some degree of flexibility, I essentially stayed on as a full-time remote employee and had to plan around
                        my SG work schedule a lot. Given the timezone differences, my afternoons and evenings were dedicated to my main job in SG (2pm - 12am),
                        and I can only make use of my mornings and weekends for any travelling, activities, or extra jobs I wanted to take up in NZ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This limited my options quite a bit - typical work holiday jobs such as fruit picking or farm work which would require longer hours
                        were out of the equation. 
                    </p>
