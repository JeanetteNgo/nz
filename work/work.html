                        Naturally, no working holiday blog would be complete without a few posts dedicated to the work experience itself.
                        I was very lucky (and super grateful!!) that my employer in SG was willing to accomodate my quest to embark on this adventure
                        - it meant that I had more leeway when it came to financing my travels, and I could seek out opportunities I was happy with
                        without worrying too much about costs.
                    </p>

                        Depending on your skillsets and industry, it might be worth negotiating an arrangement that works out for both parties,
                        if your boss is agreeable to it. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Work Arrangements</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since I stayed on as a full-time remote employee for my SG office, I didn't necessarily <i>need</i> to find jobs in NZ to 
                        sustain myself. Nonetheless, I've always wanted to try different stints that I would otherwise not have the chance to in SG.
                        Besides, how can this be counted as a work holiday if I didn't actually work? 🙃
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While I was able to have some degree of flexibility, I still needed to plan around my SG work schedule first and foremost.
                        Given the timezone differences, my afternoons and evenings were dedicated to my main job (2pm - 12am),
                        and I can only make use of my mornings and weekends for any travelling, activities, or extra jobs I wanted to take up in NZ.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This limited my options quite a bit - typical work holiday jobs such as fruit picking or farm work which would require longer hours
                        were out of the equation. I had to look for positions that offered set hours in the morning, and that would not require much
                        commitment both in terms of time and energy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, I decided to only take up work-for-accomodation arrangements, which I absolutely recommend for anyone in a similar boat.
                        You get to cut down on one of the biggest areas of expense (rent), experience the working culture in NZ, and interact with the local hosts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Given that the work is unpaid, there is also a lot less stress and expectations placed on you.
                        In fact, such arrangements are sometimes viewed as exploitative or unethical depending on your scope of work - if your labour benefits a business 
                        in any way then it is supposed to be paid. In any case, what's important to look out for would be whether you're getting a fair deal 
                        (decent food, accomodation, hours, etc.) in exchange for your labour, benchmarked against NZ's minimum wage.
